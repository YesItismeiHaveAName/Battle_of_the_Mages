Game Plan:
Strike fast and relentlessly! Play small Creatures, burn your Opponent's Face and swing in for the final Blow!
Creatures like Boasting Minotaur and Chain whirling Minotaur serve the purpose of providing mid game utility,
Burning Crystal will close out stale mates! Dragon Shamaness will call a Dragon Armee in the late Game, attacking from
a completely new Angle! No Cards in Hand, no Problem!
