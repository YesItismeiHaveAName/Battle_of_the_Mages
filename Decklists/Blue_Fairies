Game Plan:
This Deck wants to pressure a lot while also being in Control. The Fairies are very oppressive and are extremely evasive,
they also pack some trickery and allow for very, very flexible gameplay. This Deck loses to Board wipes and extrem
amounts of burn. Constructed Crystals serves as a Back Up Blocker and Attacker. High Flexibility, high Skill Ceiling!
