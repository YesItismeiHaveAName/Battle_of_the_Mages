Game Plan:

Drop a Frozen Demon on Turn 2. Remove its Ice Counters using Charm of Fire on Turn 3 and Swing for HOW MUCH?!
8?! That's HUGE! To smooth out the game play, use Deck Manipulation in Lost in Thoughts and Studying Wizards to
ensure the Combo as early as possible! Varnyx himself will stall the Game and turn each 2 Ice Counters into 1 Card!
Want to be a Mage taking Risks? Then go ahead and play Red Blue Demon!
