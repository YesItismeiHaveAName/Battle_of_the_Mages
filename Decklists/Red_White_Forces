Game plan:

Forces wants to cheat big Creatures in Play rather quickly with Assembling Forces.
Afterwards, you want to protect them with your Removal-Rituals and Creatures like Saint.
Red also allows for a lot of Handshaping with Spark of Creativity.
Fairness wants to give you some Information about your Opponents Hand.
