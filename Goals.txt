- focus on cool cards, little deck sizes and competitive gameplay that rewards smart decision making
and risk-reward-evaluation

-> Cards with a White head can be played up to thrice per deck, cards with an orange head up to twice and cards
with a red head up to once.


Each is a Spell:
Spells can be Slow OR Quick, this Attribute Dictates when you can cast any given Spell.
