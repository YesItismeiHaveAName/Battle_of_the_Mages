Battle Mages:


Deck Building:
Each player has to build a Spellbook, consisting of exactly 40 White, Blue, Green or Red Cards.
Each Player also has to build a 20 Card Crystal-Collection, consisting of Mana Crystals.


A Crystal Collection can contain any amount of Small Mana Crystals, while any Crystal Collection can only contain a set
amount of Big Mana Crystals. The maximum amount of copies eligible for each Collection is referenced by that
Cards Rarity.


-> Rewrite:
50 Card Deck, containing ALL Crystals, Creatures and Rituals.
-> Rarity still changes the maximum amount of copies able to be played in any given deck.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cards, Cardtypes and Zones:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Battle of the Mages contains several Cardtypes:

Mana Crystal (big or small)
Creature
Ritual

Creatures and Rituals are Considered to be Spells as long as they are on the Stack.
As long as they are vanished or in your Graveyard, Hand or Spellbook, these will be regarded as Cards.
-> Creatures are considered to be Creature Spells and Creature Cards
-> Rituals are considered to be Ritual Spells and Rituals Cards.


So when a Mage attempts a Spell (aka trying to play a Spell from their Hand, Graveyard, etc), Cards that target Spells
can target these Cards for as long as they are on the Stack.
The Moment they leave the Stack, they are no longer spells.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Targets and Modifiers:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an Ability or Card targets a Creature, it may only target "modified" Creatures:
flying / poisoned / damaged / exhausted Creature.
When attempting the Card / Effect, the Target chosen has to fulfill the required Conditions to be a legal target:
-> target flying Creature -> The Creature has to have Flying when attempting the Card / Ability
-> target damaged Creature -> The Creature has to have Damage Counters on it when attempting the Card / Ability

etc. The Game does not care whether the Creature does not have that modification when applying the Effects of the Card /
Ability, it is only relevant when targeting. So if a Card would "destroy target flying Creature", you can only target
Creatures with Flying. When the Stack comes to applying the Effect, the Game does not care whether the Target has lost Flying
until then or not. So if a Creature has Flying, gets targeted by said Card, and then, before the Cards effect applies,
loses Flying in any Way, the Card will still be applied.

Target Modifiers:


Counter-Specific States:

poisoned -> Target has to have at least 1 Poison Counter on it.
shielded -> Target has to have at least 1 Shield Counter on it.
strengthened -> Target has to have at least 1 Str Counter on it.
damaged -> Target has to have at least 1 Damage Counter on it.
frozen -> Target has to have at least 1 Ice Counter on it.


Keyword-Specific States:

flying -> Target has to have Flying
exhausted -> Target has to be exhausted
prepared -> Target has to be prepared


Step-Specific States:

attacking -> Target has to be attacking. (Only capable during Combat steps)
blocking -> Target has to be blocking. (Only capable during Combat steps)



Turn-Cycle:

At the beginning of the Game, players choose a Player to go first.
Then, both Players look at the Top 4 Cards of their Crystal Collection and may put any amount of them on the Bottom of
their Crystal Collection. Then, they put the rest back om the Top of their Crystal Collection in any Order.

After that, the Turn Cycle starts and repeats until a Player has won the match as follows:

Turn Player A
Turn Player B

A turn consists of the following steps:


Preparation-Step
Crystal-Step
Draw-Step
Main-Step
Combat-Step
Main-Step
End-Step



----------
COMBAT:
----------

The Combat-Step consists of several smaller Steps:
Choose-Attacker-Step
Choose-Blocker-Step
Damage-Step



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose-Attacker-Step:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The active Mage chooses the Attackers for their Combat-Step.
All Attackers have to be declared at the same time, they can only attack opposing Mages.
Any Attacker has to be exhausted in order for it to attack, unless stated otherwise.
(Attentiveness does cause Creatures to not exhaust when attacking).

-> Right now the Boast-Ability triggers.
If a Mage has multiple creatures with the Boast Ability, they can choose in what Order they want to resolve those.
The Boast-Trigger goes on the Stack, no matter whether it needs to be paid for or not.
Then the Mage controlling the Creature may choose the Targets or to pay the Costs and then Choose targets etc.
After declaring all attackers, the non-active Mage can react.
If they do or don't active Mage may now react.

Note: Creatures that entered the Field cannot attack that Turn, unless they have / gain "Rush".

If any Attacker gets removed from the Combat-Step or from the Field itself, it will never deal any Combat Damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose-Blocker-Step:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, the defending Mage can choose to block any Attacker using their creatures.
Any Amount of Creatures can block any one Attacker. The Blockers have to be prepared in order for them to be able to
declared as a Blocker. If multiple Creatures block a Creature, the active Mage chooses in which order the attacking
Creature will deal Damage to the Blockers.
Now, active Mage may react. If they do or don't, non-active Mage can react.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damage-Step
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, all Creatures deal Damage. All Blockers deal Damage to the Creature they are blocking, all Attackers deal Damage
to the Creatures they are blocked by or the defending Player. All Damage Counters are placed at the same time.
So all Creatures that are going to die to Damage will die at the same Time.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Targets, up to, a vs target:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a Spell / Ability targets a Creature / Relic / Crystal / Spell / Mage, the Controller of that Card HAS to determine
a legal Target for it when attempting that Card / Ability.
You cannot attempt a Spell when there is no legal Target for it.
If a triggerd Ability finds NO legal Target, it gets put on the Stack and fizzles upon Resolution.
(It just doesn't resolve, so the whole effect ceases to exist).
If a Spell / Ability loses at least one of its Targets, it fizzles.

If a Spell / Ability uses the wording 'up to ... target', the spell cannot fizzle.
Even if EVERY single Target is invalid upon Resolution the Spell / Ability, the Rules Text gets applied.

As an Example:
If a Card reads: "Deny target Spell."
It can only be played as long as at least 1 Spell is on the Stack.
If a Card reads: "Deal 2 Damage up to 2 target Creatures."
The Controller chooses up to 2 Creatures, and even if one or more of these Creatures where to not exist anymore
/ be an illegal target upon Resolution, the Spell STILL gets resolved. There is no such thing as Half-Resolutions.
Either a Spell / Ability resolves FULLY or it doesn't.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spells / Abilities with "Modes":
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a Spell / Ability uses the wording 'Choose X:', then its Mage chooses an equal amount of Modes when attempting that
Spell / putting the Ability on the Stack. After choosing all Modes, that Spell's / Ability's Mage chooses
Targets, etc etc.
Any Mage CANNOT rechoose Modes after having already chosen the Modes of that Spell / Ability.
