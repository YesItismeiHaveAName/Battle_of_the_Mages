Battle Mages:


Each Mage (Player) uses a Spellbook to defeat their opponent.


A Spellbook consists of 50 Cards.
The Distribution of Crystal, Creature, Ritual and Relic Cards is up to the Mage wielding their
powerful Spellbook!

Rarity:

Cards have different Rarities. Each Card's Rarity defines how often you can play it in your Spellbook!

White Rarity: Can be played up to 4 Times!
Gold Rarity: Can be played up to 3 Times!
Purple Rarity: Can be played up to once!


The ONLY Exception to this are Small Crystal Cards. A Spellbook may contain any number of any Small Crystal Card.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cards, Card Types and Zones:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Battle of the Mages contains several Card Types:

Mana Crystal (big or small)
Creature
Ritual

Creatures and Rituals are Considered to be Spells as long as they are on the Stack.
As long as they are vanished or in your Graveyard, Hand or Spellbook, these will be regarded as Cards.
-> Creatures are considered to be Creature Spells and Creature Cards
-> Rituals are considered to be Ritual Spells and Rituals Cards.


So when a Mage attempts a Spell (aka trying to play a Spell from their Hand, Graveyard, etc), Cards that target Spells
can target these Cards for as long as they are on the Stack.
The Moment they leave the Stack, they are no longer spells.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Targets and Modifiers:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an Ability or Card targets a Creature, it may only target "modified" Creatures:
flying / poisoned / damaged / exhausted Creature.
When attempting the Card / Effect, the Target chosen has to fulfill the required Conditions to be a legal target:
-> target flying Creature -> The Creature has to have Flying when attempting the Card / Ability
-> target damaged Creature -> The Creature has to have Damage Counters on it when attempting the Card / Ability

etc. The Game does not care whether the Creature does not have that modification when applying the Effects of the Card /
Ability, it is only relevant when targeting. So if a Card would "destroy target flying Creature", you can only target
Creatures with Flying. When the Stack comes to applying the Effect, the Game does not care whether the Target has lost Flying
until then or not. So if a Creature has Flying, gets targeted by said Card, and then, before the Cards effect applies,
loses Flying in any Way, the Card will still be applied.

Target Modifiers:


Counter-Specific States:

poisoned -> Target has to have at least 1 Poison Counter on it.
shielded -> Target has to have at least 1 Shield Counter on it.
strengthened -> Target has to have at least 1 Str Counter on it.
damaged -> Target has to have at least 1 Damage Counter on it.
frozen -> Target has to have at least 1 Ice Counter on it.


Keyword-Specific States:

flying -> Target has to have Flying
exhausted -> Target has to be exhausted
prepared -> Target has to be prepared


Step-Specific States:

attacking -> Target has to be attacking. (Only capable during Combat steps)
blocking -> Target has to be blocking. (Only capable during Combat steps)



Turn-Cycle:

At the beginning of the Game, players choose a Player to go first.
Then, both Players look at the Top 4 Cards of their Crystal Collection and may put any amount of them on the Bottom of
their Crystal Collection. Then, they put the rest back om the Top of their Crystal Collection in any Order.

After that, the Turn Cycle starts and repeats until a Player has won the match as follows:

Turn Player A
Turn Player B

A turn consists of the following steps:


Preparation-Step
Crystal-Step
Draw-Step
Main-Step
Combat-Step
Main-Step
End-Step



----------
COMBAT:
----------

The Combat-Step consists of several smaller Steps:
Choose-Attacker-Step
Choose-Blocker-Step
Damage-Step



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose-Attacker-Step:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The active Mage chooses the Attackers for their Combat-Step.
All Attackers have to be declared at the same time, they can only attack opposing Mages.
Any Attacker has to be exhausted in order for it to attack, unless stated otherwise.
(Attentiveness does cause Creatures to not exhaust when attacking).

-> Right now the Boast-Ability triggers.
If a Mage has multiple creatures with the Boast Ability, they can choose in what Order they want to resolve those.
The Boast-Trigger goes on the Stack, no matter whether it needs to be paid for or not.
Then the Mage controlling the Creature may choose the Targets or to pay the Costs and then Choose targets etc.
After declaring all attackers, the non-active Mage can react.
If they do or don't active Mage may now react.

Note: Creatures that entered the Field cannot attack that Turn, unless they have / gain "Rush".

If any Attacker gets removed from the Combat-Step or from the Field itself, it will never deal any Combat Damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose-Blocker-Step:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, the defending Mage can choose to block any Attacker using their creatures.
Any Amount of Creatures can block any one Attacker. The Blockers have to be prepared in order for them to be able to
declared as a Blocker. If multiple Creatures block a Creature, the active Mage chooses in which order the attacking
Creature will deal Damage to the Blockers.
Now, active Mage may react. If they do or don't, non-active Mage can react.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damage-Step
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, all Creatures deal Damage. All Blockers deal Damage to the Creature they are blocking, all Attackers deal Damage
to the Creatures they are blocked by or the defending Player. All Damage Counters are placed at the same time.
So all Creatures that are going to die to Damage will die at the same Time.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Targets, up to, a vs target:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a Spell / Ability targets a Creature / Relic / Crystal / Spell / Mage, the Controller of that Card HAS to determine
a legal Target for it when attempting that Card / Ability.
You cannot attempt a Spell when there is no legal Target for it.
If a triggerd Ability finds NO legal Target, it gets put on the Stack and fizzles upon Resolution.
(It just doesn't resolve, so the whole effect ceases to exist).
If a Spell / Ability loses at least one of its Targets, it fizzles.

If a Spell / Ability uses the wording 'up to ... target', the spell cannot fizzle.
Even if EVERY single Target is invalid upon Resolution the Spell / Ability, the Rules Text gets applied.

As an Example:
If a Card reads: "Deny target Spell."
It can only be played as long as at least 1 Spell is on the Stack.
If a Card reads: "Deal 2 Damage up to 2 target Creatures."
The Controller chooses up to 2 Creatures, and even if one or more of these Creatures where to not exist anymore
/ be an illegal target upon Resolution, the Spell STILL gets resolved. There is no such thing as Half-Resolutions.
Either a Spell / Ability resolves FULLY or it doesn't.


Whenever a Spell / Ability reads "target" / "Target", it becomes a targeting Ability.


Whenever a Spell / Ability mentions 'a Creature' / 'a Mage', it does NOT target.
Thus, its Mage does not select Targets when putting the Spell / Ability on the Stack.
The Mage chooses Targets for the Card upon Resolution, so it does NOT Target.
Thus, the Spell has an "upside" of being able to reveal the Targets later than targeting Abilities.
(Since the Opponent can react to anything TARGETING something before it resolves, while untargeted leaves the choice
open until it actually resolves.)
Similarly to 'target', 'a' cannot resolve properly if there is NO valid target upon the
Resolution of the Spell / Ability.

The same applies to Cards mentioning "any number of", "each", "every" and "all".

Ranking the Combination of selective Wordings:

target
up to target
a
up to a

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spells / Abilities with "Modes":
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a Spell / Ability uses the wording 'Choose X:', then its Mage chooses an equal amount of Modes when attempting that
Spell / putting the Ability on the Stack. After choosing all Modes, that Spell's / Ability's Mage chooses
Targets, etc. etc.
Any Mage CANNOT re-choose Modes after having already chosen the Modes of that Spell / Ability.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Direct and indirect Targeting:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In BotM, there are 2 types of Targeting:
Direct Targeting and indirect Targeting.
The difference can be seen on each Card:
Whenever a Card reads "target" or "Target", the Card targets DITRECTLY.
Whenever a Card reads "a", "each", "any number", "that", the Card targets INDIRECTLY.

The mechanical difference lies in time of choosing targets:
When a Card targets directly, it can only be attempted if the Game State contains legal targets.
As an example:
A Card reads 'This Card deals 3 Damage to target Creature.', It can only be attempted AS long AS a Creature that can be targeted is
on the Field. As long as no legal Target exists, this Card CANNOT be attempted.

If a Card targets INDIRECTLY, you choose the Targets as the Spell gets resolved.
Using the Example from beforehand:
'This Card deals 3 Damage to a Creature.'
This Card can be attempted at any point you can attempt it, whether there are legal Targets for it or not, since it
doesn't care about whether they exist at the time of attempt or not.

When this Card resolves, and there are no legal Targets for it, it just fizzles and goes to the Graveyard.

The Same goes for Abilities, except that they don't put the Card they are on in the Graveyard on fizzle.
