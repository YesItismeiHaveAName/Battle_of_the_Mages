Activated Effects:

COSTs (divided by ',') (Speed (only needed if the effect is supposed to be a slow effect)) : effect

Precedence of Costs:

1. Magic Point Costs
2. OFFERing Creatures
3. Vanishing Cards from your Graveyard or Hand or Deck
4. Discarding Cards
5. Exhausting Creatures.



For Clarity:

All cards can be divided into 2 Play-Types:

Spells, and Crystals

Spells are attempted
Crystals are put on the Field.

ALL Creatures, Rituals, Relics, are Spells.
So whenever someone puts a Spell on the Stack, it can be denied.
-> AKA put from the Stack into its Mage's Graveyard.
Implying that Crystals cannot be denied whatsoever.
