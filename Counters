This Document will Cover ALL Types of Counters and review their workings!





Damage Counter:

Whenever a Creature gets dealt Damage, you put that many Damage Counter on it.
If the Number of Damage Counter exceeds or is equal to that Creature's Vit, it gets Destroyed and put
into it's Mage's Graveyard.



Str(-ength) Counter:

Increases the Str-Attribute of the Creature it is put on by 1.
When referring to the Str of a Creature, these Counters will be added.
So if a card refers to the power of a Creature with 1 Str and 4 Str Counters on it, the result is 5.



Ice Counter:

A Creature that has Ice Counter on it will NOT prepare during its Mage's Prepare-Step nor through any other Means.
Instead, its Mage removes 1 Ice Counter from it.


Shield Counter:

If a Creature with Shield Counters gets dealt Damage, you remove a Shield Counter from it and Decrease that Damage by 1
until it either has no Shield Counters on it or the Damage reaches 0.
If, for Example, a Creature with 4 Shield Counter would be dealt 3 Damage, you remove 3 Shield Counters from it.
If it were dealt 5 Damage instead, you remove 4 Shield Counters from it and deal 1 Damage to it.
Apply Shield Counters before anything else that changes Damage-Calculations.


Poison Counter:

For Each Poison Counter on a Creature, its Strength (Str) and Vitality (Vit) will be increased by 1.
This Effect also Stacks with Damage Counters and also affects Str Counters. To calculate the ACTUAL Str if a Creature
that has Poison Counters on it, use this Formula:

Actual Str = Str + Num. of Str Counters - Num. of Poison Counters

To calculate it's Actual Vitality, use this Formula:

Actual Vit = Vit - Num. of Damage Counters - Num. of Poison Counters
