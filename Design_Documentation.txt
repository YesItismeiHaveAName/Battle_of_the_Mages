Battle of the Mages:

Design Documentation and Philosophie:


###########################################################
Core Values of the Game:
###########################################################

The Core of this Game is Decision-Making.
Battle of the Mages is supposed to be a Card Game about Decisions,
Risk Reward Evaluation and Resource and Tempo Management.

Thus, all Cards should come with a Weakness or Restriction of some Sort.
Abilities should Cost something, whether it'd be Magic Points, Cards on the Field / in the Graveyard or
Something else.

The Rarity System of the Cards in BotM is supposed to provide a new Balancing Axis:
Each Card has one of three Rarities:

White
Gold
Purple

Each Card of the White Rarity can be played uop to 4 Times per Spellbook.
Each Card of the Gold Rarity up to three Times and each Purple Rarity Card can be played up to once.

This added Axis is supposed to provide Balance:
Purple Rarity Cards are supposed to be stronger than White Rarity Cards, but they cannot provide the same Level
of Consistency as White Rarity Cards can.

So already, during Deck Building (Spellbook Building), Players need to make careful Decisions!

Creatures aren't able to tank infinite Amounts of Damage, since Damage is permanent in this Game!


###########################################################
Winning Conditions:
###########################################################

Each Mage (Player) starts the Game with 20 Points of Life and a 50 Card Spellbook.
When a Mage cannot draw from their Spellbook (since it has no Cards left in it) or has 0 or less
Points of Life, the Game of over and that Mage has lost.

Colors, Magic Points and Crystals:
###########################################################

BotM is HEAVILY inspired by Magic The Gathering, no Doubt.
And that's okay!
MtG does many Things so right!
From the gradual Build Up of the Game thanks to the Mana and Land System to the Color Pie, distributing many
Interactions and Aspects of Card Games to 4 Colors, restricting "Value-Piles" containing just the best Cards!

BotM borrows Lands, Mana and the Color Pie:

Lands are Crystals and Produce Magic Points instead of Mana.
The Color Pie has been rewritten (Black is not there anymore).

Also: The Power Level of the Cards has been adjusted.
Cards shouldn't be the Key to Victory, but rather a Piece of the Puzzle (aka the whole Game and your Way of winning it)!

There are some other parallels between MtG and BotM:

Artifacts - Relics
Creature - Creature
Instant and Sorcery - Ritual
Basic Land - Small Crystal
Land - Crystal
cast - attempted
sacrifice - offer
tap - exhaust
......

-> The "Speed" of any Card is determined by an Attribute:
Each Card (except for Crystals) has a Speed:
It is either Slow or Fast.
Cards with the Fast Speed can be attempted any Time its Mage has Priority.
Cards with the Slow Speed can be attempted any Time its Mage has Priority, during its Mage's Mainsteps and only if the
Stack is empty.


ALL activated Abilities, if not explicitly written behind the Costs of that Ability, have the Fast-Speed.



###########################################################
Core Mechanics / Ideas:
###########################################################


Battle of the Mages is supposed to be a Game that focuses on Resource Management, Counters,
building an advantage slowly but surely and smart sequencing.

Creatures can be affected by a multitude of mechanically different Counters.
Other Cards might interact with these Counters in interesting Ways!


Ice: Disables Combat and Tap-Abilities for a Creature.
Damage: Explains itself, but makes the Creature one Step closer to Dying!
Poison: Weakens the Creature from within, decreasing Strength AND Vitality!
Str: Buffs your Creature, making it better in Combat!
Shield: Reduces the Damage dealt to this Creature by 1 once!


Despite that: Deck Building and Advantage oriented Gameplay will be the KEY to Victory in BotM!
